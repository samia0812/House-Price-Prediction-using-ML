# House-Price-Prediction-using-ML
The purpose of this project is to forecast house prices by considering many features including location, size, bedroom number, and other appropriate factors. Through machine learning, the model examines past data and gives precise estimates of the price of real estate properties.

ðŸ“Œ Whatâ€™s Inside? Data Cleaning & Preprocessing â€“ Fixing missing values, scaling data, and preparing it for modeling.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) â€“ Visualizing trends, correlations, and key insights from housing data.

Machine Learning Models â€“ Trying out different models like Linear Regression, Decision Trees, and XGBoost to find the best one.

Model Evaluation â€“ Checking accuracy using metrics like RMSE and RÂ² score.

Deployment â€“ Making the model accessible via a simple Flask/Streamlit web app.

ðŸš€ Tech Stack Python â€“ Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn

Machine Learning â€“ Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost

Deployment â€“ Flask/Streamlit

Jupyter Notebook for experimenting

ðŸ“Š About the Data The dataset includes real estate listings with details like location, square footage, number of bedrooms, and more. The goal is to use this data to build a smart pricing model that can estimate house values accurately.
